# Real Estate Data Analysis: Miami and Los Angeles

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze real estate data for Miami and Los Angeles to uncover investment insights. It involves data collection, cleaning, and descriptive analytics, using Excel and Tableau as the two main tools. We collected real estate listings from `redfin.com`, transforming raw data into actionable insights for potential real estate investors.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to provide concrete, data-driven advice to real estate investors looking to make informed decisions in the Los Angeles and Miami markets. By applying rigorous data cleaning methodologies and descriptive analytics, we aim to reveal patterns and trends that can guide investment strategies.
<!-- 
## Requirements
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data collection, cleaning, and preliminary analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **PDF Viewer**: To access the final report detailing our findings and recommendations. -->

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two parts:

### Part A: Data Collection and Cleaning
- **Data Source**: Real estate listings from `redfin.com` for Miami and Los Angeles areas.
- **Excel Workbook** (`real_estate_data.xlsx`): Contains multiple sheets, each representing a step in the data cleaning process, from consolidating raw data to cleaning formats and addressing data quality issues.

#### Data Cleaning Process
- **Consolidation**: Merging data from various areas into a single, cohesive dataset.
- **Standardization**: Aligning column formats and data types across the dataset to ensure uniformity.
- **Quality Control**: Identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers to improve dataset reliability.
- **Enrichment**: Augmenting the dataset with calculated fields like $/SQFT for deeper analysis.
These steps were critical in transforming the raw listings into an analytically valuable dataset, ready for further exploration and visualization.

### Part B: Descriptive Analytics and Reporting
- **Tableau Workbook** (`descriptive.twbx`): Utilizes the cleaned data to create dashboards, tables, and charts. This part focuses on visualizing the behavior of the real estate market in the selected areas, providing a narrative that supports investment decision-making.
- **Final Report** (`report.pdf`): A comprehensive document summarizing the project's findings. It integrates the visualizations from Tableau with a narrative that outlines actionable insights for real estate investors.

<!-- ## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning**: Proficiency in Excel functions (e.g., VLOOKUP, IF, TRIM, CLEAN) and Power Query for preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Ability to use Tableau for creating meaningful visualizations that highlight market trends and insights.
- **Analytical Thinking**: The project showcases the ability to translate raw data into understandable and actionable information for decision-making.
- **Technical Writing**: Developing a clear and concise report that integrates complex analyses into strategic recommendations. -->

## Getting Started
To explore the project, start by opening the `real_estate_data.xlsx` in Microsoft Excel to review the data cleaning process. Then, use Tableau Desktop to interact with the `descriptive.twbx` for in-depth analysis and insights. Finally, read through the `report.pdf` for a comprehensive overview of the findings and recommendations.
